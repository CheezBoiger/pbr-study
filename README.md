# How do I build this sh*t?
You need CMake and Git for this.  
Clone this repo (don't forget to add submodules as well)
```
git clone https://github.com/Cheezboiger/pbr-study.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
then call cmake:
```
cmake path/to/pbr-study
```
depending on what OS you built this project on, you either run the makefile if you are using linux, or open the .sln file for windows (if you used visual studio).
